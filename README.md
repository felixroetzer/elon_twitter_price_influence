# elon_twitter_price_influence
This project aims to provide evidence of the influence of Elon Musk's Twitter posts on financial markets.
Therefore I analyzed financial data provided from Binance between the time of 01-01-2020 until 30-06-2023, with prices in the interval of 5 minutes.
Tweets data uses a csv file called "elonmusk.csv" from Kaggle.
Clear correlation can be shown specifically for DOGE, meaning that he can influence smaller assets more strongly, given the limited liquidity.
